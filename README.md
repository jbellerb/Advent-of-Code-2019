# Advent-of-Code-2019
This repository contains my (currently work-in-progress) solutions to the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) programming competition. I used this competition to work on my Haskell skills, and hopefully my code improved as I progressed through the competition. I wasn't competing for the leaderboard, so I spent a bit of time making my solutions neat, but they are still quite sloppy as they only really exist to generate a specific result. I may clean them up at a later date, but probably not.
